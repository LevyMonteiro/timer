# Timer

## About

Discover a meticulously crafted timer countdown designed to enhance focus during study sessions, offering Session and Break types inspired by the Pomodoro technique.

This React-based application not only leverages hooks for efficient state management but also employs the Context API to seamlessly share data between components. The toggle theme functionality ensures a personalized experience, with changes persistently stored in the browser through local storage.
